Databasedotcom Console creates an executable called 'dbdc' that wips up an interactive ruby console that is connected to your Salesforce instance.

If you're tired of using Excel formulas, CSV files or other arduous tools to work with Salesforce data, this is the gem for you.

The console is Just Plain Ruby(TM) so you can use any ruby methods you want to process your salesforce data.  You can of course require other ruby libraries as well.
